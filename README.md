### This repository contains problems that I solved on codewars. I reached level 4 kye. I studied topics such as:
- Loops and primitives
- Arrays and their methods
- Strings and their methods
- I worked with objects
- Sorting
- Functional programming
- OOP: this, class, prototypes
- recursion

### There are no asynchronous tasks presented on codewars itself, but I independently analyzed and solved the following problems:
- polyfills for race, settled, any
- retry decorator
- wrote my own implementation of debounce, throttle, cache.
